# Netflix Movies & TV Shows Analysis  

This is one of my first data analysis projects.  
I used the **Netflix Movies and TV Shows dataset (Kaggle)** to practice working with data in Python.  

## What I did
- Cleaned the dataset (handled missing values, fixed columns)
- Looked at Movies vs TV Shows
- Checked how Netflixâ€™s content grew over time
- Found the top countries and most common genres
- Did a small spotlight on Australian titles

## Tools
- Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- Matplotlib for charts

## Some insights
- Netflix has way more movies than TV shows (~70/30 split)  
- Content additions really spiked after 2015  
- The US, India, and UK lead in number of titles  
- Dramas and Comedies are the most common genres  
- Australia has a smaller share, but still some unique titles  

## Outputs
Charts and a short summary are saved in the `outputs/` folder.

*This project was mainly about getting comfortable with Python, cleaning data, and making simple visuals. Next Iâ€™ll try building dashboards and adding machine learning projects.*
